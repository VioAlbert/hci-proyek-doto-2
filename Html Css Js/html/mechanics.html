                <p>Doto 2 gameplay is interesting and challenging, but new players often find it difficult to get started. We will explain the game mechanics to aid those new players. Let's dive in!</p>

                <h5><b><u>GAME CONTROLS</u></b></h5>
            </div>
            <img class=""src="../asset/controls.jpg" alt="">
                <p>After picking your role and hero, the game will start. But we have to know how to control your own hero and play it properly to win the game. The main controls of hero are divided into 4 parts, movement analog, basic attacks buttons, active skills buttons, and battle spells buttons.</p>
                <p><b>Movement Analog</b> can be found in the bottom-left corner of the screen. This analog is used for moving your hero along the lane. As this analog is circular, you can move your hero to 360 degree of direction.</p>
                <p><b>Basic Attacks Buttons</b> can be found on the bottom-right corner of the screen. There are 3 buttons in basic attacks. The middle button is the general attack that will make your hero launch a normal attack to the targeted enemy. The other two buttons are used for locking specific target and launch attack to either turrets or creeps. </p>
                <p><b>Active Skills Buttons</b> are circular buttons found at the bottom right hand corner of the screen. They are ordered from bottom to top, with the hero’s most powerful skill or known as ultimate skill is placed at the top.</p>
                <p><b>Battle Spells Buttons</b> can be found in the bottom-middle of the screen. They are unique spells that you choose before the start of each game. These spells give our hero an advantage during the gameplay. We can use these battle spells to increase hero's attack, speed, defense, health and mana, or recall to the base.</p>
                <p>Beside those main controls, there are also some support controls such as a mini map that representatives a whole lane in the top-left corner of the screen, three buttons in top-right corner of the screen to alert allied team to gather, attack or retreat and a button below the map that redirect to build items shop.</p>

        <section id="objective" class="content">
            <div class="title">
                <h5><b><u>AREA OBJECTIVES</u></b></h5>
            </div>
            <img class=""src="../asset/objectives.jpg" alt="">
                <p><b>Lanes</b> are known as top, middle, and bottom area in the gameplay. In each of this lane, there are monsters which known as "creeps" that will spawn from the base. Between the lanes, there is also an uncharted area called jungle. The jungle is a place for neutral monsters that are hostile to both player teams. Defeating neutral monsters or creeps brings various benefits to the players and their team, such as growth in power, buffs, or assistance in pushing the lane.</p>
                <p><b>Turrets</b>, also known as defensive turrets or towers, are the main line of defense building for both teams during battlefield. These buildings will attack non-neutral enemy units on sight range. The damage will get stronger and stronger if the target doesn't escape. Turrets have a priority system that will target the first enemy that gets in their range and attack until the target dies. Once that happens, they choose another target which is the closest to them.</p>
                <p><b>Spawning Platform</b> is known as the base of both teams. When the game starts, all of the heroes from both teams will be placed in this platform. Spawning Platform provides massive health and mana regeneration to all allied units near it. It also greatly defends the spawn area, blasting intruding enemies with very rapid high damaging attacks, which grow stronger with each blow.</p>
                <p><b>Nexus</b> is the core building structures and known as the main objective in the gameplay. Similar to turret, this building also attacks non-neutral enemy units within its range but the range is wider than other normal turrets. In order to win, the enemy team's nexus must be destroyed, while the own must be kept alive. </p>
